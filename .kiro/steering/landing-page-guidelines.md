# Landing Page Development Guidelines

## Design Principles

- **Human-First Messaging**: Always emphasize the human-like qualities of the AI
- **Story-Driven**: Lead with narrative and emotional connection before technical features
- **Professional but Approachable**: Enterprise-grade but not intimidating
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear progression from problem → solution → benefits → action

## Content Guidelines

- Use "AI Agent" not "chatbot" - chatbots are robotic, we're human-like
- Emphasize "remembers," "understands," "waits," "responds naturally"
- Always mention 24/7 availability as a key benefit
- Focus on business outcomes: more sales, happier customers, less manual work

## Technical Implementation Standards

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Page load time under 3 seconds
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- SEO optimized content structure

## CTA Strategy

- Primary CTA: "Watch Demo"
- Secondary CTA: "Contact Sales"
- No free trial references
- Multiple contact options (email, phone, live chat)

## Visual Design

- Blue-teal gradient color scheme (existing)
- Clean, modern typography
- Card-based layouts with subtle shadows
- Animated elements for engagement (blob animations, hover effects)
- Icons from Lucide React library

## Component Structure

- Maintain existing component architecture
- Enhance rather than rebuild
- Add new Story component between Hero and Features
- Keep responsive design patterns consistent
